# Data Scientist Job Change Prediction

A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists. Many people signup for their training. Company wants to know which of these candidates really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment 
because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training.

Our Project is designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave their current job.
